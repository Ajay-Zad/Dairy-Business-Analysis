Overview: 
This repository contains a Power BI report dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of a dairy business's operations. The dashboard offers insights across multiple dimensions of the business, including sales performance, inventory management, and more. By leveraging data from various sources, the dashboard enables data-driven decision-making to optimize business performance and enhance overall operations in the dairy industry.

Data Sources: 
The dashboard integrates data from a single table (.csv file) to provide a holistic view of the dairy business operations. The table include: Dairy_dataset

Data Cleaning and Transformation: The initial data contained various irregularities, including NULL values, incorrect data entries, improperly formatted data, and empty cells. To ensure accurate and reliable analysis, rigorous data cleaning and transformation activities were performed using Power BI:

Data Profiling: Analyzed the data to understand its structure, quality, and relationships.
Handling Missing Data: Replaced or removed NULL values and empty cells to maintain data integrity.
Data Transformation: Reformatted data to ensure consistency and accuracy, including parsing dates, correcting data types, and standardizing units of measurement.
Data Validation: Verified the accuracy of data entries against known standards and business rules.
Filtering Unnecessary Data: Removed irrelevant or redundant data points to enhance the dashboard's focus and performance.

The dashboard is designed to help users analyze business performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize operations and sales strategies within the dairy business.

NOTE: The original CSV file contained various irregularities, including NULL values, incorrect data, improperly formatted data, and empty cells, all of which were addressed during the creation of the dashboard using Power BI.
